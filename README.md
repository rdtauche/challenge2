## Project Description

This is my SECOND challenge homework assignment for the BootCamp course titled "Module 2: Advanced CSS".  The following criteria were given to complete the challenge:

    1. Build your own personal portfolio page from scratch
    2. Below are the acceptance criteria:
        GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
        WHEN I load their portfolio
        THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
        WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
        THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
        WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
        THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
        WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
        THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
        WHEN I click on the images of the applications
        THEN I am taken to that deployed application
        WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
        THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
        ```

## Credits

BrandLogo = i found a very cool site called "https://www.brandcrowd.com/" where i was able to create my own "brand logo" with my last name, TAUCHERT, embedded in it.  I designed and then purchased the right to use this logo on my website.  This website also allowed me to design the "COMING SOON" and "SEO" images seen on my portfolio page.

I found https://www.w3schools.com/ to be very helpful with basic guidance on how to structure the main components of an HTML doc like nav, main and footer components, as well as for the corresponding CSS attributes. I also used this site for help in creating the "CONTACT ME" form.
